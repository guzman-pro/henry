        <p>You started following me on <i>Tandem.</i><br> 
        Then I did the same.<br>
        You said <i>Hola cómo estás?</i><br>
        And Christmas was unique that year... <b>we were not alone again.</b></p>
        <p>The time passed and we both were distant to each other. There were things to solve.<br>
            But the hope never ends for us, because we were made to be together.<br>
            When te day arrived the universe conspired in our favor... <i>we met again.</i><br>
            But this time was different: we both didn't want to be separated again.<br>
            So we started our love story.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>My dear baby: you are the most beautiful guy all around the world! <br>
            I love you with all my heart! I am completely into this relationship that we both are starting and<br> 
            I want to find where it goes.</p>
        <p>I want to ask you something...<br>
        Would you give me the possibility to show you how much you meant to me?<br>
        Yours forever, Enrique</p></i>
